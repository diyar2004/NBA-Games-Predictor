# NBA-Games-Predictor
This project predicts NBA game outcomes by analyzing box scores. First, box scores are scraped and cleaned using BeautifulSoup, then parsed into pandas DataFrames. Key predictors are identified through feature selection, and a machine learning model is trained on these features. Rolling predictions are applied to enhance accuracy over time.
